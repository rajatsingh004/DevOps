Using observability you can get what is the state of the system.
Utilization of Disk, CPU or Memory
Succesful/Filed https request count out of 1000

Obs also tells why the state is like that.
It'll also help in how to fix the issues.
You can get the traces of the issues.

What: Metrics: Gives historical data of events
Why: Logging (Logs): Have different types of logs like info, debug, error and trace
How: Traces: will help in debug, troubleshoot and fix the issue,

Diff b/w monitoring and obs?
Monitoring: metrics + alerts + dashboard
Observability: Monitoring + Logs + Tracing

SLA
To be upholding the agreement we need to have obs in place so that whenever we get frist failure, we resolve it so that the SLA is not broken.
Eg: Our product responds to 10,000 request in 20ms, and we have a success rate of 99.5% meaning only 5 requests might fail which means when we get the first failure request, 
we can resolve the problem ther eonly if we have OBS in place.


OpenTelemetry: It is a popular CNCF platform, it is a collection of APIs and SDKs which can help instrument the above 3 things.
